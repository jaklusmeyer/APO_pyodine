# pyodine

An I2 analysis code for the determination of precise radial velocities from extracted input spectra, using the I2 cell method developed by [Butler et al. (1996)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996PASP..108..500B/abstract){:target="_blank"}. The code is open-source and build in a flexible and modular approach to allow easy adaptation to different instruments; it has been tested successfully on Lick and SONG spectra thus far.
