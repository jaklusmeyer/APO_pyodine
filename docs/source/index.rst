Welcome to pyodine's documentation!
===================================

The **pyodine** package helps you to determine precise *radial velocities* from stellar spectra, using the iodine (I2) cell method developed by `Butler et al. (1996) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996PASP..108..500B/abstract/>`_.

Check out the :doc:`overview` section for further information, including how to :ref:`install <installation>` the project.
