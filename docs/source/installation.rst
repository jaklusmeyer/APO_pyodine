Installation
============

To install **pyodine**, the only way right now is to simply download or clone it from its Gitlab repository:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://gitlab.com/Heeren/pyodine.git

Now you can use it by importing it into your own Python code where needed (check out the *Tutorial* section on how to import and use it: :doc:`tutorial/preparation`).

Of course you should make sure that you have all dependencies installed - these will only be Python packages:
