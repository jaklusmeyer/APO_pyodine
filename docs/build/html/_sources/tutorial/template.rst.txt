Create a deconvolved stellar template
=====================================

Before modelling observations of the star to extract RVs, we need to create a high-S/N stellar template


What you need:

- observation spectra of hot stars, which do not show any spectral features in the I2 wavelength range between ~ 5000 -- 6000 Å, obtained *with* the I2 cell in the light path; the recorded spectra then basically only consist of the I2 features, and can be used to determine the LSF of the instrument. 

- observation spectra of the star of interest *without* any I2 absorption features;
