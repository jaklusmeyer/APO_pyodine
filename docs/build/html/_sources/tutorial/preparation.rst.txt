Prepare the environment
=======================

In the following tutorial, we will use **pyodine** to compute RVs from SONG spectra for the star !!!!XYZ!!!! This includes three basic steps:

- using I2-free observations of the star, plus B-star spectra *with* the I2 cell, to :doc:`create a deconvolved stellar template <template>`;

- with that template, :doc:`modelling the I2 observations <observation>` of the star to arrive at best-fit parameters (including, most importantly, the chunk velocities);

- :ref:`weighting and combining the chunk velocities <tutorial_combine_velocities>` to compute the RV timeseries of the observations.

In each of these steps, we will present how to use built-in methods of **pyodine** to visualize and analyze the results.


But, first of all, we need to prepare everything.


The I2 atlas
------------

-> if you have your own, bring it into the correct hdf5-format

-> here, we just use the one by SONG


The utilities module
--------------------

-> prepare all instrument-specific code, such as I/O of spectra, modelling parameters etc.

-> again, we just use the existing ``utilities_song`` module
